# basic Amazon-like book library

### Objective

The objective of this project was to create a simple command line based book library where users can search based on authors, titles or genres. The application will recommend similar type of books once they choose their desired one.

### Description

The code should be simple and contain at least one class. Our approach was to code the entire application first and then do refactoring however we spent all time with coding the prototype and didn't do the refactoring at all. Therefore, the master branch app doesn't contain any classes and it is full of while loops and if/else statements however the app is fully functional.

The additional branches contain trial versions with refactored code each with different progress status unfortunately none of them are finished.
